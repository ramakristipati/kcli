    Deploys an openshift SNO ISO using openshift-install, particularly suited at Baremetal
    With sno_wait, we wait for installation to finish
    This typically requires to be able to reach the cluster API through DNS
    a VIP can be added to the ISO to ease connection.
    The baremetal_hosts array can be used to use redfish to start the node using an iso
    This assumes a web server such as apache/nging to be running where this process is launched from.
    baremetal options exist to only copy the ISO to a given place (useful if you run the web server using a container by yourself).
    You can set sno_vm to true to deploy a vm using the ISO and wait for install to finish which is handy if your hypervisor is short on resources
    and can handle having a temporary bootstrap vm such as the one used in regular kcli create cluster openshift workflow
    You can use all the parameters available in the regular workflow, in particular you can set an api_ip to use in the SNO (to ease access)
